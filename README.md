Yep — I can help you make a clean README for your repo. Here’s a draft based on what I see (and what we discussed). You can copy this into a file named README.md in your project root and tweak things as needed.

# Multi-Agent MCP

A Multi-Agent MCP built with **Google ADK** using YAML configurations and Firecrawl.  
This project provides an out-of-the-box UI via `adk web` and supports multi-agent workflows with tracing.

---

## 💡 Features

- Define agents and workflows with simple YAML files  
- Uses `google-adk` and `firecrawl-py` for agent orchestration  
- UI dashboard via `adk web`  
- Environment variable support (keeps API keys secure)  
- Tracing, logging, and observability built in  

---

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- macOS, Linux, or Windows  
- Python 3.8+  
- Git  
- (Optional but recommended) Homebrew (for installing tools)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pkinaganti/Multi-Agent-MCP.git
   cd Multi-Agent-MCP

	2.	Create a virtual environment & activate it

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # macOS / Linux
# .\.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows (PowerShell)


	3.	Upgrade pip

python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip


	4.	Install dependencies

pip install -U google-adk firecrawl-py pyyaml


	5.	Configure API keys
Create a .env file in the root and add:

GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=0
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_api_key


	6.	(Optional) Add .gitignore
Ensure your .gitignore includes:

.venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.env
.vscode/
.DS_Store



⸻

🚀 Run the App

adk web

Open the URL shown in your browser (e.g. http://localhost:8000).
Use the UI to interact with your agents.

⸻

🛑 Stop & Deactivate
	1.	In the terminal running adk web, press Ctrl + C to stop the server.
	2.	Deactivate the virtual environment:

deactivate



⸻

🔐 Security & Best Practices
	•	Never commit your .env file (this contains your API keys)
	•	Use environment variables, not hardcoding secrets
	•	Add your .env to .gitignore

⸻

📁 Folder Structure

Multi-Agent-MCP/
├── .gitignore
├── .env
├── my_first_agent/
│   └── sub_agents/
│       └── research_agent.yaml
├── README.md
└── …

	•	my_first_agent/sub_agents/ — Contains your agent YAML definitions
	•	.venv/ — Virtual environment (ignored by Git)

⸻

🧪 Testing & Verification

You can test that the YAML is loaded and the environment is working by writing a small Python snippet:

import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
print("FIRECRAWL key:", os.getenv("FIRECRAWL_API_KEY"))

Run:

python test_env.py

You should see your Firecrawl API key printed (only when .env is correct).

(You can add whatever license you like — MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.)

If you like this README, I can help you add badges (build status, coverage) or tweak it more.  
Do you want me to generate **README.md** content ready for you to paste into your repo (or commit it for you)?
